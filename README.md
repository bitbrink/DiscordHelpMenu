A simple bot for various help buttons used in a Discord information channel

Creating a way to quickly and easily get users to the resources they need in a fast and minimal way can be difficult sometimes when there is just so much to share.

Use this bot to create simple Discord Buttons that reply with different resource links. Store it in your #information channel, and have your staff team use it to quickly guide someone in chat to what they need.

Use **!links** to send the message with your related links, and **!install** to send the message with different installing resources.

I have left the program just as it is being run currently on one of our servers, hopefully making it easier for you to visualize and customize it to your liking and needs.
